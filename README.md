## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
dict = {"dog": "human's best friend", "cat": "destroyer of world"}
dict["dog"]# == "human's best friend"
len(dict["cat"]) # == 18
# but if we try to create a pair with the same key as an existing key
dict["dog"] = "Arf"
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are an aspiring data scientist who wants to take your first steps in data science, this book is for you. If you have the basic math skills but want to apply them in data science, or you have good programming skills but lack the necessary math, this book will also help you. Some knowledge of Python programming will also help.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).
